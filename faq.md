## Frequently Asked Questions

---

### Is this illegal? What about copyright infringement?

Like many things, it depends on **`how you use it`**. There is currently no mechanism to detect or prevent copyright infringement on the network. we are using public domain movies for our platform. However, there will never be a way to prevent someone from committing copyright infringement that wants to do so. That decision is ultimately left up to each person. Our goal is to limit infringement to only those who willfully want to commit it.

### What happens when I access the app?

You will replicate and maintain a copy of the metadata, not the actual database, once somebody else connects to the network they are going to get a copy of the metadata from the nearest node.

### What happens when I sign out?

You will stop receiving any updates to  metadata will eventually be removed from your computer. if you log back in to the app you will adquire the metadata again like is the first time opening the app.

### What happens when I try to play a movie?

*We use a process to turn the dowloaded  bits of the metadata for the movie and turn it into video.*

You wll recived the stream data from somebody that is already watching the movie or you will become the primary node sharing (`seeding`) the metadata of the movie, this will help you and other to download the stream faster while helping other.

### Will there be data on my computer that I have not asked for?

**Never**. You only get data that you request and you will only keep data that you have chosen to stream.

### Can i find any move i like?

To avoid copyright infringement You can only search for movies that are available for the public domain. we hope in the future we can work with partners to bring you a more up to date database of movie. so please be patience this is just the begining.
